## Inspiration

I wrote a similar tool which was a request from the 2D Builds department at Atomic Cartoons. The tool allows for characters/props to copy & paste pivot/positional values interchangeably from one source peg to another (or multiple). The request came for <i>Pinecone & Pony</i>, which coincidentally was produced by DreamWorks (in collaboration with Atomic)!

## My Version

Allows riggers to copy & paste rotational or skew values to another character/prop node, or multiple at once. The UI is dynamic- no need to have any layer pre-selected.

## Benefits

Build artists won't have to manaully update/edit these properties through the nodes' layer attributes.

## Software/Languages

```
Toon Boom Harmony
JavaScript
Qt Designer
```

## Feedback

The copy/paste pivots & positions script started out for Pinecone & Pony (Atomic-Ottawa), but is now being used across all active shows in the pipeline.
This includes shows across Vancouver and LA. It is a widely used custom tool I developed for artists using Harmony at the studio.
